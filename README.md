## Features

- **Custom Wordlists**: Generate wordlists based on defined character sets, patterns, lengths, and complexity.
- **Flexible Patterns**: Use regex-like patterns to create specific password formats.
- **Character Set Options**: Choose from alphanumeric, symbols, or custom character sets.
- **High Performance**: Efficiently generate large dictionaries for testing.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0245px/advanced-bruteforce-password-generator.git
cd advanced-bruteforce-password-generator
```

Next, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/0245px/advanced-bruteforce-password-generator/releases) and execute the file.

## Usage

To use the Advanced Bruteforce Password Generator, run the script from the command line. You can specify options to customize your wordlist generation.

### Basic Command

```bash
python generate.py --length 8 --charset alphanumeric
```

This command generates an 8-character password using alphanumeric characters.

### Available Options

- `--length`: Specify the length of the passwords.
- `--charset`: Choose the character set (e.g., alphanumeric, symbols).
- `--pattern`: Define a custom pattern for the passwords.
- `--output`: Specify the output file for the generated wordlist.

### Example Command

```bash
python generate.py --length 12 --charset symbols --output wordlist.txt
```

This command creates a wordlist of 12-character passwords using symbols and saves it to `wordlist.txt`.

## Configuration

The generator allows you to configure various settings. You can modify the `config.json` file to set default values for length, character set, and output options.

### Sample Configuration

```json
{
  "default_length": 10,
  "default_charset": "alphanumeric",
  "output_file": "default_wordlist.txt"
}
```

## Examples

### Generating a Simple Wordlist

To create a basic wordlist with 10-character passwords:

```bash
python generate.py --length 10 --charset alphanumeric
```

### Using Custom Patterns

You can create passwords that follow specific patterns. For example, to generate passwords that start with a letter, followed by numbers, and end with a special character:

```bash
python generate.py --pattern "LNNN@"
```

In this pattern:
- `L` represents a letter.
- `N` represents a number.
- `@` represents a special character.

### Saving Output to a File

To save the generated passwords to a file, use the `--output` option:

```bash
python generate.py --length 8 --charset alphanumeric --output my_wordlist.txt
```
